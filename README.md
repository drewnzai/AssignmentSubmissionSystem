# ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSION PROJECT

This project seeks to provide a web portal that revolves around assignments.

There are three users: administrators, students, and lecturers.

An administrator can add/delete students, add/delete lecturers, add/delete units.

A lecturer can add/delete assignments, and marks student submissions.

A student can make submissions for pending assignments.

The backend is built using SpringBoot 3.0 and Java 17.

The frontend is built using Vite + React, with Typescript.
